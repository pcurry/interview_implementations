For the interview question, I implemented a function that calculated the lengths of the words in a sentence, and created a dictionary of the words found, keyed by word length. Each key had a list of words of that length, organized in the order the words were encountered. I then returned the dictionary, as well as the first encountered word of the shortest length and the first encountered word of the greatest length.

Assumptions include that punctuation separating words doesn't count towards word length, but that hyphenated words and contractions count their included punctuation. Periods don't count, and ellipsis doesn't count as a word.

The three functions I created - one which does the work, the other two which take outputs of that work - have some testing coverage written using Python's 'unittest' module. Running the Python file with a Python 3.3+ interpreter should run the unittests, which should pass. Otherwise, you could include the file as a library or otherwise import the working functions from it.
